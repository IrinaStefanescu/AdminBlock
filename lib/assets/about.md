**About us**



Welcome to Admin Block, your number one source for your housekeeping maintenance and administrative operations.


We're dedicated to giving you the very best of our mobile application, with a focus on receiving your housekeeping bill monthly, downloading to your local storage and sending documents or pictures, sending emails with complaints and paying your bill.


Founded in 2022 by Irina Stefanescu, Admin Block has come a long way from its beginnings in Bucharest, Romania. 




When Irina Stefanescu first started out, her passion for her passion for providing a stable, user-friendly application that can help a person's life by saving time drove her to do tons of research, work day and night so that Admin Block can offer you a simpler way to manage administrative tasks in a block community.
 
 
 
We now serve as a startup idea for Irina Stefanescu's final exam and are thrilled to welcome you on board.



I hope you enjoy my products and services as much as I enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me.





Sincerely,

Irina Stefanescu
